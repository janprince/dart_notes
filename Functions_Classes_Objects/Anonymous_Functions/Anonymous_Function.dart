///                 Key features of Anonymous Function
///
//
/// We can declare any anonymous function without a function name.
//
///• We can assign it to a variable.
//
///• The anonymous function can be passed into another
///function, as we’ll see later.
//
///• In the longhand version, we need to use a semicolon to
///terminate the statement because we assign it to a variable.
//
///• The only disadvantage of an anonymous function is we
///cannot use it recursively as it has no name
//
